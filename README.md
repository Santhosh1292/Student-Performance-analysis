# Student-Performance-analysis
# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to **predict student performance** using **machine learning algorithms**.  
By analyzing **student demographics, attendance records, study habits, and academic scores**, the system can identify **at-risk students** early and recommend intervention strategies.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Predicts GPA** based on key student attributes  
- **Early detection** of students at risk of poor performance  
- **Interactive Streamlit dashboard** for real-time predictions  
- **Multiple machine learning models** tested for best accuracy  
- **User-friendly interface** for educators to enter student data  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (for model development)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data preprocessing)  
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** (for machine learning)  
- **Streamlit** (for web-based dashboard)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)  

## 📊 Model Performance  
After testing multiple models:  
- **Random Forest & XGBoost** provided the best accuracy  
- **Feature Importance Analysis** showed that attendance rate & study hours significantly affect performance  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** is optimized for better predictions
